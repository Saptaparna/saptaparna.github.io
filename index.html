<h3>Research: Contribution to the <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/"> Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment </a> at the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/"> Large Hadron Collider (LHC) </a> </h3>

I have worked on the following projects as part of my association with the CMS collaboration:

<ol>
  <li> <b> Search for SUSY, April 2014-Present: </b> <br>
      In the spring of 2014, I started working on a search for SUSY in low transverse momenta, OS di-lepton final states. This is a challenging final state and only sparsely explored in hadron colliders due to stringent requirements that are placed at the trigger level on the lepton to keep the trigger rates low. To mitigate the high transverse momenta thresholds in traditional di-lepton triggers, the trigger chosen for this analysis was one that required a good quality photon candidate and calorimetric transverse missing energy (MET) of 25 GeV. Since calorimetric MET does not take into account muons, the di-muon final state was unaffected by this trigger level requirement. This allowed the exploration of several NP scenarios such as models where dark matter candidates are light or in looking for Z-boson decays into J/Psi gamma candidates. The electron-muon final state is used to look for SUSY in compressed spectra models with significant MET, such as stop pair production (in the Simplified Model scenario) and chargino - neutralino production where the trigger level MET requirement does not prove to be a hindrance. The compressed-spectra SUSY models are characterized by final states with low hadronic activity and low transverse momenta leptons. Therefore, variables such as the scalar sum of the jet momenta and the invariant mass of leptons provide good handles to reduce SM backgrounds such as Zgamma or ttgamma (Z-boson or tt-produced in association with a photon) as these processes dominate the high end of these spectra unlike the signal. The lepton momenta thresholds in this analysis are 5 GeV and 7 GeV for muons and electrons respectively. 
      The analysis is sensitive to stop masses between 90-100 GeV and model independent limits exclude NP scenarios with cross sections greater than ~250 fb. This search constitutes my dissertation and I have been leading the analysis. I have generated the signal Monte Carlo (MC) samples, written the analysis code and designed the optimization criteria, along with the documentation of the results. <br>
  <li> <b> Search for Tprime, 2012-2014: </b> <br>
      I have worked on a search for heavy top-like fermions or top-prime as proposed by the model (<a href= "http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0792"> Prospects for top-prime quark discovery at the Tevatron, Bogdan A. Dobrescu, Kyoungchul Kong, Rakhi Mahbubani and the extended phenomenology (as described in Sec. 2) </a>). I am looking at the pair production of these quarks and their subsequent decays into <b>Wb</b>, <b>tZ</b> and <b>tH</b>. This leads to six different event topologies. I studied the multilepton channel in all of these decay processes. Several event categories were contructed involving opposite signed, same signed and trileptonic (&le; 3 leptons) final states. A cut and count experiment was done in 12 bins. The analysis resulted in the <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1557571?ln=en"> CMS PAS B2G-12-015 </a>. </li> <br>
  <li> <b> Sensitivity study for ECFA, August 2013-September 2013: </b> <br>
      I worked on a sensitivity study for the Tprime analysis at &radic; s = 14 TeV.</li> <br>
  <li> <b> Search for Top-partners, January 2012-January 2013: </b> <br>
      I have worked on a search for heavy exotic quarks that have a charge of 5/3. The pair production of such quarks leads to multiple <b>W</b> decays (produced directly and through top decays). Such decays lead to the presence of same-signed dileptons in the final state. This feature is utilized to separate the signal from backgrounds such as <b>tt</b> or <b>W</b>+jets. In particular, I have worked on the determination of fake leptons from multi-jet processes where both leptons are fake or cases where one lepton is fake and the other is a true lepton. The analysis has been performed at both &radic; s = 7 TeV and &radic; s = 8 TeV. These analyses are documented as <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1478430?ln=en"> CMS PAS B2G-12-003 </a> and <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1524087?ln=en"> CMS PAS B2G-12-012 </a>. </li> <br>
  <li> <b> B-tagging: 2009-2011: </b> <br>
      I worked on "System 8", a data driven method to calculate b-tagging efficiecies. This is a method to estimate b-tagging effificiency with the use of two different b-tagging algorithms with minimal dependence on Monte Carlo simulations. This study resulted in CMS public documents <a href=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1366061?ln=en> CMS PAS BTV-11-001 </a> and <a href=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1427247?ln=en> CMS PAS BTV-11-004 </a>.</li> <br>
  <li> <b> Tracking, 2009-2010: </b> <br>
      I was involved in the Lorentz Angle Calibration of the CMS Tracker. The Lorentz Angle is calculated to correctly identify the hit positions in the Tracker. The 3.8T magnetic field causes sensors to drift with an angle with respect to the electric field lines. This deflection is about 15-20&mu;m. I worked on Cosmic Runs at 3.8T (CRAFT) '08 and '09 data and 2T cosmic runs. </li> <br>
  <li> <b> LHC Upgrade, 2009-2010: </b> <br>
      I have participated in the LHC upgrade (S-LHC) studies for the silicon tracker. This involved testing the viability of using Magnetic Czochralski Silicon in the tracker. Test beam studies performed from 2007-2009 indicate that n-type Magnetic Czochralski Silicon would be adequate for the S-LHC radiation environment. The result of this study can be found in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900210015172"> Proceedings of the 12th International Vienna Conference on Instrumentation </a>.</li> <br>
  <li> <b> Merged and non-merged b-jets 2008-2009: </b> <br>
      I worked on a study of merged and non-merged b-jets. The motivation for the study was that heavy flavor quarks obtained from gluon splitting form a significant Standard Model background to supersymmetry in the b-jet and missing transverse energy channel. A multivariate analysis was carried out based on secondary vertex information. A boosted decision tree was generated which showed separation between signal-like (merged b-jets) and background-like (non-merged b-jets) events. This study is documented <a href="cmsnote_gbbar.pdf"> here.</a> </li> <br>  

</ol>

<h3>Research: Contribution outside of the CMS collaboration</h3>

In addition to working within the CMS collaboration, I have also worked with Prof. Bogdan Dobrescu from Fermilab on the following phenomenology project: 

<ol>
  <li> <b> Higgs production though Top-prime decays at the LHC: </b> <br>
      I am studying a quark which is vector-like in nature, unlike the standard model chiral quarks. Such a quark, top-prime, is allowed to "mix" with the standard model particles via interactions with the top quark. Higgs (at a mass of 125 GeV) production through the decay of the top-prime in a top-prime pair production channel at the LHC with &radic; s = 7 TeV and &radic; s =  8 TeV is being looked into. The background discrimination strategy involves same-signed dileptons in the final state. This analysis has neared completion and the final version of the paper is being drafted. </li> <br>
  <li> <b> Search for Tprime, Projection Analysis leading to a Snowmass whitepaper, June 2013-August 2013: </b> <br>
     I worked on the projection of the CMS &radic; s = 8 TeV analysis at 14TeV and 33TeV. This study was documented as a Snowmass white paper.
